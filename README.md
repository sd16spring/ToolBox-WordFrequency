# ToolBox-WordFrequency
Word Frequency Analysis Project Toolbox

The Basics:

Returns a list of the top 100 most common words in a .txt file (currently The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland) from Project Gutenberg


To Run Code: 

In the terminal run 		python frequency.py


To Understand/Change Code:

To run this code on another piece of text from Project Gutenberg place the new .txt file in the same folder as this script and update the text name in line 69.

Note that this code can be run on other files, but we attempt to clean the Gutenberg book files (line 24) and extra code is needed to convert non-txt files to .txt
