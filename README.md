# ToolBox-WordFrequency
Word Frequency Analysis Project Toolbox starter code, edited and completed by Duncan Hall. This script utilizes the tabulate method from the tabulate library in a funciton on line 58. This library's documentation can be found [here](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tabulate), and can be installed with `pip install tabulate`. Alternatively, comment out lines 6 and 58, uncommenting 60 to print the a list of tuples of words and frequencies.
